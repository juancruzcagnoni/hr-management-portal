# HR Management Portal

A production-grade Human Resources management system built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Supabase. Designed to demonstrate enterprise-level frontend patterns including real-time data, optimistic UI updates, and a SAP Fiori-inspired design system.

## Features

- **Dashboard** with KPI cards, headcount trend chart, department breakdown, seniority distribution, and recent hires
- **Employee directory** with server-filtered search, multi-column filters, and TanStack Table v8 pagination
- **CRUD operations** — create, edit, and delete employees via modal forms with Zod validation
- **Optimistic updates** — UI reflects changes instantly before the server confirms, with automatic rollback on error
- **Real-time notifications** — Supabase Realtime pushes live events (new hire, update, delete) to a notification inbox without polling
- **CSV export** — exports the current filtered dataset with one click
- **Dark / Light / System theme** toggle
- **SAP Fiori-inspired design** — system font stack, SAP Blue (`#0070f2`) as primary color, enterprise layout with fixed sidebar

## Pages

### /dashboard
KPI cards (total headcount, active employees, turnover rate, avg. tenure), headcount trend line chart with cumulative overlay and monthly average reference line, department bar chart, seniority donut chart, and a recent hires feed.

### /employees
Full data table with avatar, name, email, area badge, seniority badge, status badge, and hire date. Filters by name/email search, area, seniority, and status. Add Employee and Export CSV buttons in the toolbar. Per-row actions: view profile, edit, delete.

### /employees/[id]
Employee profile with large avatar, status/area/seniority badges, and detail cards for email, hire date, tenure, department, and seniority level. Employment details section with employee ID, record creation date, and current status. Inline edit button.

## Key Patterns

**Optimistic updates** — `useUpdateEmployee` and `useDeleteEmployee` use TanStack Query's `onMutate` to immediately patch all cached query variants via `setQueriesData`, then roll back on error using a saved snapshot. No visible latency on user actions.

**Realtime notifications** — `useNotifications` opens a single Supabase channel with `postgres_changes` listeners for INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. A `useRef` guard prevents double-subscription in React StrictMode. INSERT events also invalidate the TanStack Query cache, keeping all views in sync without polling.

**Query key factory** — `employeeKeys` provides a structured key hierarchy (`all → lists → list(filters) → detail(id)`), enabling surgical cache invalidation by prefix across all active queries.

**Server vs Client components** — layout wrappers, KPI cards, and profile cards are Server Components. Interactive elements (table, filters, modals, charts, notification bell) are Client Components marked with `"use client"`.

## Getting Started

### 1. Supabase setup

Run [`supabase/schema.sql`](supabase/schema.sql) in your Supabase SQL Editor, then enable Realtime for the table:

```sql
alter publication supabase_realtime add table employees;
```

### 2. Environment variables

```bash
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### 3. Install, seed and run

```bash
npm install
npm run seed      # clears and inserts 36 sample employees
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) — redirects automatically to `/dashboard`.

## Why this project?

Built to demonstrate:

- **Enterprise UI architecture** — fixed sidebar shell, sticky header, responsive grid layout aligned with SAP Fiori design conventions
- **Advanced TanStack Query** — optimistic mutations with rollback, query key factory, cross-cache patching via `setQueriesData`
- **Supabase Realtime** — websocket-based live updates without polling or manual refresh
- **TypeScript discipline** — strict mode throughout, no `any`, Zod v4 schemas inferred end-to-end from validation to mutation input
- **UX detail** — structured skeleton screens that mirror real content layout, empty states, error boundaries, and toast feedback on every action
